 * Intermission scene 1: "They meet".
 * <p>
 * Pac-Man leads Inky and Ms. Pac-Man leads Pinky. Soon, the two Pac-Men are about to collide, they quickly move
 * upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide and vanish. Finally, Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of
 * the screen and a big pink heart appears above them. (Played after round 2)
